# AI-Driven Audit Log Risk Scoring (Azure DevOps MLOps Pipeline)

This project demonstrates how **AI and DevOps** can be integrated to automate **risk scoring** of financial audit logs using unsupervised learning. Built and executed entirely on **Azure DevOps**, this project highlights real-world **MLOps practices** for internal audit modernization.

## Highlights

- Applied **Isolation Forest** to detect anomalies in simulated audit logs
- Built a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** in Azure DevOps for data simulation, model scoring, and result logging
- Showcased reproducible and modular **Python + YAML**-based AI workflow
- Demonstrates transparency and automation for audit and compliance workflows
